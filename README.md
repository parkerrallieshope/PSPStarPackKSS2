# PSP Star Pack for KSS2
My first star pack meant for KSS2 and probably one of the first ever made.

## Installation

Installing is very easy, simply go to the releases section and download the latest main release for PSP, unzip it, and merge everything with KSS2.

## Dependencies

Dependencies include KSS2 and it's main dependency, Kopernicus of course. This pack also requires Sigma and Singularity (black hole shader mod).

Recommended dependencies (**OPTIONAL**): Parallax 2.0 and EVE Volumetric Clouds

## NOTES

Please take these notes about the pack into consideration.
* Most stars do not have planets around them. There are only 2 star systems with planets around them, Miza and Beteljise. These bodies are Gachi, around Beteljise, and Yunoo, around Miza, with it's moon Huleg.
* I highly, **HIGHLY** recommend having the Aethera system for KSS2 installed with this.
* Parallax is currently not supported, as there are no parallax configs for the planets that do exist in this pack.

This pack is not licensed, so you don't **HAVE** to include my name if you make something off of this and publish it, but I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
